    <p>
      The main parts of a plant are roots, stem, branches, leaves, fruits and
      flowers. The roots of a plant hold it to the ground. Big trees such as the
      banyan tree have thick roots. Plants also use the roots to absorb water
      from the ground. The stems carry water from roots to the leaves.

      Plant need water, air and sunlight to live. The green leaves are the
      kitchen of the plant. Plant make their food here. Plant also breathe
      through tiny open pores in their leaves. The stems carry the food produced
      in the leaves to the different parts of the plant. Flowers grow into
      fruits. Fruits have seeds inside them. New plants grow from these seeds.
