    <h1>The Four Directions</h1>
    <p>There are four main directions - North, South, East and West. We can easily locate the directions with the help of the Sun. On a bright sunny morning, go out in the open. Stand in the Sun and stretch your arms. Point your right arm towards the Sun. The direction is East. The direction on your left side is West.</p>
