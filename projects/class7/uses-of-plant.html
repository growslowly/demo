    <h1>Uses of Plants</h1>
    <p>
      Plants are very useful to us. We eat different parts of the plant as food.
      We eat the fruits of the plants. We eat the seeds such as rice, corn,
      pulses. We eat roots such as turnip, betroot and carrot. We eat stems such
      as sugarcane. We eat leaves such as spinach, lettuce and cabbage.
